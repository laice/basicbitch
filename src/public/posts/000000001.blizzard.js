    `   blizzard has a couple shitty ideas right now, 
      the first being limiting sms protect to only non-prepaid phones. 
      so now my account is less secure due to my choice of phone provider. 
      ok. simultaneously, they take a shit on my privacy by enabling Real ID 
      without my knowledge, so when i load the destiny 2 beta my 
      real name gets broadcast when i type.

  thanks for invading my privacy and making my account impossible to 
  secure, blizzard.`,
